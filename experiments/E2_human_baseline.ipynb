For example, Candidate [[B]] correctly explains that high inflation can erode purchasing power and reduce economic growth, whereas Candidate [[A]] incorrectly states that a higher inflation rate is generally associated with a stronger economy.\\\\n* Candidate [[B]] provides more accurate and detailed information on how fiscal and monetary policies affect economic indicators. For example, they explain that expansionary fiscal policy can stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment, but also lead to higher inflation and a larger budget deficit.
